## Security Considerations

Password storage: Passwords are stored in an encrypted binary file in "~/.local/share/cruxpass/"
Authentication: cruxPass requires authentication before accessing or modifying stored passwords.
Best practices: Always use strong, unique passwords and never share them with others.

NOTE: Use it at your own risks, as this project was implemented for a better understanding of file IO,
basic encryption and decryption, data serialisation and deserialization. You might need to clear your bash
history after saving a password with the -s option.
